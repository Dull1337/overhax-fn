# overhax-fn

- oracle + maven and a few paid exploits and you have a new p2c called overhax

note : since people are stupid i decided to be more clear.

the source was originally (or partially, this is disrupt's pasted version) made by dano20zombie, the same person who made FortUpdater.
he sold the source to disrupt1337 and now he thinks he's a dev


people wouldn't stop pasting it so here we go (specifically the retard zerax/virtualization/furiosdestruct/astro the 12 year old)

creds to like 3 people that sent me the src 

proof zerax is a skid : https://imgur.com/gallery/Ok2yqOr
